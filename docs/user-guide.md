- **Current Selection Display**: Shows the selected region and wavelength

#### 2. Conversion Panel (Middle)
- **Wavelength Input**: Enter values in meters, nanometers, micrometers, or millimeters
- **Frequency Input**: Enter values in Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz, or THz
- **Energy Input**: Enter values in eV, meV, keV, or MeV
- **Unit Dropdowns**: Select your preferred units for each measurement

#### 3. Educational Panel (Bottom)
- **Region Information**: Detailed description of the current electromagnetic region
- **Applications**: Real-world uses and applications
- **Examples**: Common sources and examples
- **Safety Information**: Important safety considerations where applicable

### Theme Switcher

Located in the top-right corner:
- **Light Mode**: Bright interface for daylight use
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes for low-light environments
- **System Mode**: Automatically follows your device's theme preference

## Basic Operations

### Exploring the Spectrum

**Method 1: Click on the Spectrum Bar**
1. Look at the colored spectrum bar at the top
2. Click anywhere on the bar to select that wavelength
3. Watch as all panels update to show information about your selection
4. The position indicator (arrow and line) shows your exact location

**Method 2: Use the Conversion Panel**
1. Click in any of the three input fields (wavelength, frequency, or energy)
2. Type a value and press Enter or click outside the field
3. All other values automatically update
4. The spectrum visualization jumps to your selected wavelength

**Method 3: Use Unit Dropdowns**
1. Click on any unit dropdown (nm, Hz, eV, etc.)
2. Select your preferred unit
3. The value automatically converts to the new unit
4. This helps you work in units you're most comfortable with

### Understanding the Display

**Wavelength Values**:
- Displayed in scientific notation for very small/large values
- Common units: nanometers (nm) for visible light, meters (m) for radio waves
- Range: 1 femtometer (gamma rays) to 1000 kilometers (radio waves)

**Frequency Values**:
- Shows how many wave cycles occur per second
- Higher frequency = shorter wavelength
- Range: 3 kHz (radio) to 3×10²⁴ Hz (gamma rays)

**Energy Values**:
- Photon energy in electron volts (eV)
- Higher energy = shorter wavelength
- Range: 1 meV (radio) to 1 GeV (gamma rays)

## Advanced Features

### Precision Input

**Scientific Notation**:
- Enter values like `5e-7` for 5×10⁻⁷
- Use `E` or `e` for the exponent
- Example: `2.5E14` for 2.5×10¹⁴ Hz

**Range Validation**:
- Values are automatically clamped to valid ranges
- Invalid inputs show error messages
- Out-of-range values are adjusted to nearest valid value

### Keyboard Navigation

**Tab Navigation**:
- Use Tab to move between input fields
- Shift+Tab to move backwards
- Enter to confirm input and move to next field

**Accessibility Features**:
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard-only operation possible

### Educational Features

**Region Detection**:
- Automatically identifies which electromagnetic region you're exploring
- Provides region-specific information and context
- Shows boundaries between regions

**Real-world Context**:
