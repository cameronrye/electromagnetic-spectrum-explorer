## Scientific Background: The Electromagnetic Spectrum

### What is the Electromagnetic Spectrum?

The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is the complete range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space at the speed of light. These waves are characterized by their wavelength, frequency, and energy, which are all mathematically related.

### Fundamental Physics Relationships

All electromagnetic radiation follows these fundamental relationships:

1. **Speed of Light Equation**: `c = λ × f`
   - c = speed of light (299,792,458 m/s)
   - λ (lambda) = wavelength in meters
   - f = frequency in Hertz (Hz)

2. **Photon Energy Equation**: `E = h × f = (h × c) / λ`
   - E = energy in Joules or electron volts (eV)
   - h = Planck's constant (6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s or 4.135667696 × 10⁻¹⁵ eV⋅s)
   - f = frequency in Hz
   - c = speed of light
   - λ = wavelength in meters

3. **Inverse Relationships**:
   - Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional (shorter wavelength = higher frequency)
   - Wavelength and energy are inversely proportional (shorter wavelength = higher energy)
   - Frequency and energy are directly proportional (higher frequency = higher energy)

- **Derived Values**: Frequency and energy are calculated on-demand from wavelength
- **Theme State**: Managed by ThemeContext, persisted to localStorage
- **No External State Management**: Uses React's built-in state and context (no Redux/MobX)

### Performance Considerations

- Pure function calculations are fast and predictable
- Logarithmic scaling allows smooth visualization across 20+ orders of magnitude
- Minimal re-renders through proper component structure
- Optimized production build with Vite
